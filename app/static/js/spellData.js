The undead can be made to follow you or they can be made to remain in place and attack any creature (or a specific kind of creature) entering the area. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed undead can't be animated again. You can create one or more undead creatures with a total CR of no more than (CASTERLEVEL/2). You can only create one type of undead with each casting of this spell. Creating undead requires special materials worth 1000 credits * the total CR of the undead created; these materials are consumed as part of casting the spell. The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell however you can control only a number of undead whose total CR is no greater than (CASTERLEVEL). If you exceed this number all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Once released such undead have no particular feelings of loyalty to you and in time they may grow in power beyond the undead you can create. The corpses you use must be as intact as the typical undead of the type you choose to create. For example a skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse (that has bones) or skeleton. A zombie can be created only from a creature with a physical anatomy.",

The arcane eye sees exactly as you would see if you were there. The arcane eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers block its passage but it can pass through a hole or space as small as 1 inch in diameter. The arcane eye can't enter another plane of existence even through Drift travel or a magical gate or similar magical portal. You must concentrate to use an arcane eye.

Casting this spell takes intense personal focus and requires you to spend 1 Resolve Point. The chance for successfully receiving a meaningful reply is 75%; this roll is made secretly by the GM. A question may be so straightforward that a successful result is automatic or it may be so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds you get one of four results; Weal (if the action will probably bring good results) Woe (for bad results) Weal and woe (for both) Nothing (for actions that have neither especially good nor especially bad results). If the augury isn't successful you get the nothing result. A spellcaster who gets the nothing result has no way to tell whether it was the consequence of a failed or successful augury. The augury can see only about 30 minutes into the future so anything that might happen beyond that time frame does not affect the result. Thus the result might not take into account the long-term consequences of a contemplated action.

Valid targets include a large broken computer system nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system or any related electronic components or combination of the above as long as the junk is found in a large enough quantity. Creating a battle junkbot also requires one ultra-capacity battery. Casting this spell drains all of the battery's charges. While casting this spell you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with aggression and martial skills. A battle junkbot is Small its KAC and EAC are each (CASTERLEVEL+15) it has hardness 15 and it has a number of Hit Points equal to half of your own (but no Stamina Points). It uses your saving throw bonuses when it is the target of spells and other targeted effects. It has a land speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet with average maneuverability. For purposes of spells and effects that target the junkbot it is treated as a construct with the magical and technological subtypes. The battle junkbot has four hands. It is treated as if it had the Deadly Aim and Improved Combat Maneuver (Bull Rush Grapple Trip) feats. It has an attack bonus  of (CASTERLEVEL+6); in one hand it wields a special buzzblade dagger that deals 6d8+6 damage instead of its normal damage and a second hand carries a special light laser pistol that deals 6d6 damage instead of its normal damage. Damage from the junkbot's special weapons counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. You can give new basic commands to your battle junkbot telepathically on your turn as a move action and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature. You are aware when the robot has made an attack or combat maneuver and whether or not it was successful as well as when the battle junkbot has been attacked has taken damage or is destroyed but you can perceive nothing else through this basic telepathic link. When the battle junkbot is destroyed or this spell ends the electronic equipment you used to create the junkbot falls apart into refuse its circuitry fried beyond anything recognizable.

For the spell's remaining duration the fallen starstuff makes the entire area difficult terrain and thick swirling clouds of particulate space matter magically block vision. This obscures all sight beyond 5 feet including darkvision and other vision-based senses (including vision-based blindsight and sense through) but doesn't prevent blindsense. A creature within 5 feet of its attacker has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Additionally the swirling cosmic particles are distracting to spellcasters in the area who have a 20% chance of losing any spell they attempt to cast in the area.

A question is answered by the power during the same round. You can ask (CASTERLEVEL/2) questions. On rare occasions this divination may be blocked by an act of certain deities or forces. Contacting a minor planar power is relatively safe but may not result in useful answers. For each question you ask the GM secretly rolls 1d20.

On a failed check your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for a week and you are unable to cast spells for that period. [3-5] You receive a random answer to the question. [6-10] You receive an incorrect answer to the question. Based on the nature and needs of the creature contacted this may be a lie designed to harm you. [11-15] You receive no answer to the question. [16 or More] You receive a truthful and useful one-word answer. If the question can't be truthfully answered in this way no answer is received. Contact with minds further removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed by the power's sheer strangeness and force but it also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly.

A creature or object within the area that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected (though if it stays in the area it must succeed at a new save each round or become affected) but it might still suffer secondary effects (such as an object flying up from reversed gravity or an object falling upon it when the spell ends). You choose how to have this spell affect gravity when you cast it and you cannot change it without recasting the spell. If two control gravity spells affect the same area they negate each other in the area of overlap. If you reverse gravity in an area you cause unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the affected area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the spell's area without striking anything it remains there oscillating slightly until the spell ends. At the end of the spell's duration affected objects and creatures fall downward. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling in either direction. If you increase gravity in the area creatures and objects weigh twice as much as normal move at half speed can jump only half as far as normal and can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by one step (from average to clumsy for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Acrobatics check to fly to remain in the air. An area of zero-g works like the zero-g environment (see page 402). You can also use this spell to make areas of zero-g heavy gravity or light gravity act as normal gravity for the duration (see page 402).",

[Area Discharge] When used in this way the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by discharge (affecting only one object in the creature's possession) and each unattended object is similarly affected. [Targeted Discharge] If this spell targets a single creature it can discharge (CASTERLEVEL/4) randomly determined objects from the target's charged or electrically powered possessions.",

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells as detailed in their descriptions can't be defeated by dispel magic. Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like abilities just as it does spells. The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways as a targeted dispel or as a counter. [Targeted Dispel] One creature object or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as zone of truth). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way or otherwise uniquely identify it (such as that burning wall or the spell that's giving him those duplicates). Attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell's caster level. If you succeed the spell ends. If you don't specify a spell and there is more than one possible spell on the target your targeted dispel attempts to dispel a spell at random. If you target a force an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as unseen servant) you attempt a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item you attempt a dispel check against the item level (DC = 11 + the item level). If you succeed all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. A magic item's nonmagical physical properties are unchanged; a suppressed holy laser pistol is still a laser pistol. Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast. [Counter] You can use the energy of dispel magic to disrupt the casting of other spells. First select an opponent and take the ready action (see page 249) to cast dispel magic when that target casts a spell. This is considered a purely defensive action. When that readied action is triggered you cast dispel magic and must attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) to counter the other spellcaster's spell. The DC is equal to 11 + the other spellcaster's caster level. If the check is successful and the target is in range the spell fails and has no result.",

You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways a targeted dispel an area dispel or a counter. [Targeted Dispel] This functions as a targeted dispel magic but you can dispel one spell for every 4 caster levels you have attempting a separate dispel check for each spell. Additionally greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any curse that remove affliction can remove even if dispel magic can't dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse's DC.

If you don't specify spells and there is more than one possible spell on the target your targeted dispel attempts to dispel spells at random. Magic items themselves are not affected by an area dispel but additional magical effects on them may be dispelled. For each ongoing spell effect whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell apply the result of the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell apply the result of the dispel check to end the effect but only within the overlapping area. If an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell is in the area apply the result of the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.

If you and the target have a common language you can generally force the target to perform as you desire within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists you can communicate only basic commands such as Come here Go there Fight and Stand still. You know what the target is experiencing but you don't receive direct sensory input from it nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping eating and so forth). Changing your orders or giving a dominated creature a new command is a move action. By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action) you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the target though it still can't communicate with you. You don't actually see through the target's eyes but you still get a good idea of what's going on. The target resists this control and any target forced to take actions against its nature can attempt a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited as long as you and the target are on the same plane. You don't need to see the target to control it. If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each following day the target can attempt a new saving throw to throw off the domination.

A creature within 50 feet of the singularity has its speed reduced by half when it moves away from the singularity. However it can move at double its normal speed when moving toward the singularity. If a creature moves within 30 feet of the singularity at any point in its movement it is subject to the combat maneuver described above. A creature that moves neither toward nor away from the singularity moves at its normal speed.

This spell can target any living unconscious or deceased sentient creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (or a modifier of -4 or higher). If the target is deceased it cannot have been dead for longer than 1 week or this spell fails; once a corpse has been subjected to hologram memory by any caster any subsequent attempts to cast hologram memory on that corpse fail. If the target is unwilling to share this memory (or if it would be unable to share the memory in the case of an unconscious or deceased target) it can attempt a Will saving throw with a +4 bonus to negate this spell and its effects.",

The disk continues to ricochet in this way until it has attempted to strike five creatures or until there are no more valid targets or until you voluntarily end the spell.

If there are multiple valid targets the microbots can harass the cloud will split into a maximum of four 5-foot-square segments and pursue different targets. The cloud (and any segments thereof) has a fly speed of 20 feet. Each round on your turn the microbot cloud grants harrying fire (see page 247) against the foes in its spaces. In addition the cloud grants covering fire (see page 246) to anyone attacked by foes in its spaces. The microbots constantly repair themselves and the cloud generates new microbots every few seconds so any attack against them is essentially ineffective.",

Since the dead creature is returning in a new body all physical ills and afflictions are removed. The condition of the creature's remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature's body still exists it can be reincarnated but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the creature's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes 1 hour to complete. When the body is ready the target is reincarnated. A reincarnated creature recalls the majority of its former life and form. It retains any class features feats and skill ranks it formerly had. Its class base attack bonus base save bonuses and Hit Points are unchanged. The creature should recalculate its ability scores from scratch as a member of its new race (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). The target of the spell gains 2 permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the target is 1st level it takes 2 Constitution drain instead (if the Constitution drain would reduce its Constitution to 0 or less the creature cannot be reincarnated). The target creature can decide whether its new body retains any of the implants it had in its former body. A spellcasting creature has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell. For a humanoid creature the new incarnation is determined using the table on the facing page. For nonhumanoid creatures a similar table of creatures of the same type should be created. Elementals outsiders and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. Any creature that can't benefit from the mystic cure spell cannot be reincarnated. The spell can bring back a creature that has died of old age. The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form including any forms of movement and speeds natural attacks extraordinary abilities and the like but it does not automatically speak the language of the new form it takes.

Depending on your desired effect (choose one from below) the spell can perform a variety of combat maneuvers provide a gentle sustained force or exert a single short violent thrust. [Combat Maneuver] Once per round you can use telekinesis to perform a ranged attack that acts as a bull rush disarm grapple (including pin) or trip combat maneuver. Resolve these attempts as normal but use your caster level plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. No saving throw is allowed against these attempts but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last (CASTERLEVEL) rounds but it ends if you cease concentrating. [Sustained Force] A sustained force moves an object of no more than (CASTERLEVEL*25) pounds or (CASTERLEVEL*2) bulk up to 20 feet per round in any direction (including up or down). A creature can negate the effect on an object it holds with a successful Will save or with spell resistance. This version of the spell lasts (CASTERLEVEL) rounds but it ends if you cease concentrating. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the spell's range. You can telekinetically manipulate an object as if with one hand. For example a lever can be pulled a key turned a button pushed an object rotated and so on if the force required is within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots though a delicate activity such as this requires a successful DC 15 Intelligence check. [Violent Thrust] The spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl up to 15 objects or creatures that are within range (no two of which can be more than 10 feet apart) toward any target within 150 feet of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 400 pounds or 40 bulk. You must make attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items using your base attack bonus plus your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. All objects cause damage ranging from 1 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for less dangerous objects) to 1d10 damage per 25 pounds or 2 bulk (for extremely dangerous objects such as weapons or bladed or spiked objects). Objects and creatures that miss the target land in a square adjacent to the target. Creatures that fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be hurled but they can attempt Will saving throws (or rely on spell resistance) to negate the effect as can those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell.

All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As the caster you need not attempt a saving throw nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use by another creature receive saving throws and benefit from spell resistance. You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy can make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works roll d% and consult Table 10-1. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. [Familiarity] Very familiar describes a place you have been very often and where you feel at home. Studied carefully describes a place you know well either because you can currently physically see it or because you've been there often. Seen casually describes a place you have been to more than once but with which you are not very familiar. Viewed once describes a place you have seen once in person or have extensively studied through scrying magic remote cameras or recorded images (for a remote-viewed location you still need to have a clear idea of the location; you can't teleport to an unknown location that you've seen in a holovid). False destination describes a place that doesn't truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location it is a place that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table rather than rolling d% since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from. {On Target] You appear where you want to be. [Off Target] You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. [Similar Area] You wind up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range the spell simply fails instead. [Mishap] You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 2d10 damage and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls roll 1d20+80. Each time mishap comes up the creatures take more damage and must reroll. [TELEPORTATION RESULTS] Very familiar - 1-97 On Target 98-99 Off Target 100 Similar Area; Studied Carefully - 1-94 On Target 95-97 Off Target 98-99 Similar Area 100 Mishap; Seen Casually - 1-88 On Target 89-94 Off Target 95-98 Similar Area 99-100 Mishap; Viewed Once - 1-76 On Target 77-88 Off Target 89-96 Similar Area 97-100 Mishap; False Destination - 81-92 Similar Area 93-100 Mishap;",

A xenodruid mystic instead uses crystals and incenses worth 30000 credits. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain but it doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the ground. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees but it doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment. You can alter the climate by one step (cold temperate or warm). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM but in general it changes to a similar terrain type or by one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth from a shallow bog to a deep bog and so on). Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration. This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change the type of bordering terrain and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis.

		"LONGDESCRIPTION": "Your overwhelming presence bores into the target's mind cowing its will. This turns it into an automaton-like guardian that protects you at all costs. As soon as it is able the target mindlessly moves along the most direct route toward you and stops when it is within 10 feet of you (provoking attacks of opportunity for movement as normal). If you are being attacked in melee by a creature within 10 feet the target instead takes the quickest route to intercept that creature from a square within 10 feet of you and attack it on your behalf. While this spell is in effect the target attacks any creature that attacks you in melee though it can't move more than 10 feet from you to do so. If multiple creatures are attacking you in melee you can choose which creature the target attacks on your behalf as part of combat banter. If you are the target of ranged attacks and your guardian is not attacking a melee assailant on your behalf it moves to provide cover against the ranged attacks. Due to the strong momentary connection between you and your unwilling guardian if you are the single target of a hostile creature's spell or effect the creature must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 6 + your caster level) or the spell or effect instead targets your guardian. This spell has no effect on area of effect or multi-target spells or other effects that include you as a target. When this spell ends the target regains control of its faculties entirely and it knows and remembers that you used magic to control it. Once a creature has been the target of unwilling guardian it can't be targeted with this spell again for 24 hours if cast by the same spellcaster.",
