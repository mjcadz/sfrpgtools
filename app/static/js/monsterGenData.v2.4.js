    "Combatant": "The <b>combatant</b> option is for an NPC that will primarily fight in physical combat, such as a bodyguard or a feral beast. Such NPCs represent significant threats on the field of battle. These attacks are often physical but they might also be strange supernatural abilities.",
    "Expert": "Pick the <b>expert</b> option for skilled enemies such as stealthy scouts or non-combatants such as merchants or advisors. Expert NPCs benefit from a wide array of skills, making them competent at specialized tasks such as sneaking or sabotage.",
    "Spellcaster": "Use the <b>spellcaster</b> option for any NPC whose main capabilities come from casting spells or using spell-like abilities. Spellcaster NPCs usually have the most unusual abilities."

The drone does not get a full suite of actions on its own; each round, the mechanic creature and the drone can each take a move action, a swift action, and a reaction, but only one of them can take a standard action or combine its move and standard actions into a full action. The drone doesn’t have its own CR, it doesn’t contribute to the CR of the encounter, and PCs receive no XP for defeating a drone.

An opponent can give itself an advantage against this ability in one of two ways.\nLooking Obliquely: An opponent that avoids looking directly at the creature's face (either by following the creature's shadow or by tracking it in a reflective surface) or that looks at the creature through a camera or heads-up display gains a +4 circumstance bonus to the saving throw. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains concealment against that opponent.\nBlocking Its Vision: By completely blocking or covering its own visual sensors, an opponent doesn't need to attempt a save against the gaze. However, the creature with the gaze ability gains total concealment against that opponent.\nGaze abilities can affect ethereal opponents but not opponents without visual sensors.

      "Description": "The creature can avoid the effects of some spells and spell-like abilities that would directly affect it. To determine whether a spell or spell-like ability works against a creature with spell resistance, the caster must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result equals or exceeds the creature's spell resistance, the spell works normally, though the creature can still attempt any saving throws normally allowed.",

    "Stellar Alignment (Su)": {
      "Description": "The creature is aligned to the cycles of solar systems. Creatures with stellar alignment usually have stellar revelations and zenith revelations, either ones from the solarian class or ones unique to the creature. When using stellar revelations, the creature is always considered attuned. However, it's not always considered fully attuned, so it normally can't always use zenith powers. When you roll initiative for the creature, roll 1d3. Once that many rounds have elapsed, the creature is considered fully attuned and gains access to its zenith powers. After it uses a zenith power, it's no longer fully attuned and you roll 1d3 again to see how many rounds it will take to recharge.\nIf a creature has stellar alignment (graviton) or stellar alignment (photon), it's considered to be attuned only in the indicated mode and can become fully attuned only in the indicated mode, as described above.",

    "Swallow Whole (Ex)": {
      "Description": "If the creature hits with the indicated attack (usually a bite attack), it deals the normal damage. If the creature's attack roll successfully hits the target's KAC + 4, the creature also automatically grapples the foe as part of the attack action. (If it hits the target's KAC + 13, it instead pins the target). The creature doesn't need to have a free limb to perform this grapple. Unless otherwise specified, a creature can swallow whole only targets that are at least one size category smaller than itself, and it has room for a single target of that size in its stomach (doubling the maximum number of creatures it can have swallowed for each additional size category by which these creatures are smaller).\nOn the creature's next turn after grappling or pinning the target, if the target has not escaped the grapple or pin, the target automatically takes the attack's damage at the beginning of the creature's turn. The creature can then make a new attack roll with the same attack. If it hits the target's KAC, the grapple or pin is maintained. If it hits the target's KAC + 4, the target is swallowed whole (no damage is dealt).\nOnce swallowed, the target takes the listed swallow whole damage automatically at the beginning its turn every round.\nThe target is considered grappled as long as it is swallowed.\nThe target can attempt to cut its way out (the interior of a creature with swallow whole has the same EAC as its exterior and a KAC equal to that of its exterior - 4) by dealing an amount of damage equal to one-quarter the swallowing creature's total Hit Points, though any attack that does not deal slashing damage deals only half its normal damage. If a target cuts its way out of the creature, the creature cannot use swallow whole again until that damage is healed.\nAlternatively, a target swallowed whole can attempt to climb out. The swallowed creature must succeed at both a grapple check against the creature's internal KAC + 8 and an Athletics check to climb (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 * the creature's CR).\nEach of these actions takes a full round. If both checks are successful, the target climbs back up to the creature's mouth and can escape, ending up in an open square adjacent to the creature.",

For the purpose of automatic fire, the swarm counts as five targets. For example, if an automatic attack is made using 12 rounds of ammunition, it can attack a maximum of six targets, so it can damage a swarm normally. However, if two other targets are closer to the attacker than the swarm, they must be attacked first, leaving only four attacks to target the swarm, so it takes no damage.",

      "Description": "The creature can use the Perception skill to perform the follow tracks task of the Survival skill with the listed sense.\nThe sense is usually related to a type of signature that most creatures leave behind, such as a scent or heat trail. The creature might gain a bonus or penalty to its Perception check to follow tracks depending on the strength of the quarry's signature, at the GM's discretion. It is possible for stronger signatures to completely mask other signatures, making following tracks with a weaker signature very difficult.",

      "Description": "As a full action, the creature can move up to its speed and through the space of any creatures that are at least one size smaller than itself. The creature does not need to make an attack roll; each creature whose space it moves through takes damage. A target of a trample can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to take half damage; if it attempts the save, it can't make an attack of opportunity against the trampling creature due to the creature's movement.

Instead, it deals automatic damage to any creature within its reach or whose space it occupies at the end of its turn, with no attack roll needed. A troop threatens all creatures within its reach or within its area and resolves attacks of opportunity by dealing automatic troop damage to any foe in reach that provokes an attack of opportunity.

A troop can perform grapple and sunder combat maneuvers, but no other combat maneuvers, unless the troop’s description states otherwise.",
      "Format": "Melee troop attack (1d4+10 P)."
      "Guidelines": "To determine the amount of damage a troop of CR 6 or lower deals with its troop attack, use the dice value listed for CR 6 in the Melee Damage, Three Attacks column on its appropriate array table (see pages 129–132 of Alien Archive), lowering the additional damage added to the dice value to match the additional damage of its actual CR and adding its Strength modifier as normal. For creatures of all other CRs, use the damage listed in the Melee Damage, Four Attacks entry for its CR in the corresponding array table."

    "Troop Defenses (Ex)": {
      "Description": "Troops take damage from attacks differently depending on how the attack targets them. A troop takes half damage from attacks that effect a single target (such as shot from a semi-auto pistol). A troop is immune to effects that target a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells and multiple-target spells such as haste). A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from effects that affect all targets in an area, such as grenades, blast and explode weapons, and many evocation spells. A troop takes normal damage from an attack or effect that affects multiple targets (including lines and fully automatic mode attacks).

The creature is immediately destroyed when it reaches 0 Hit Points. An unliving creature doesn't heal damage naturally, but a construct can be repaired with the right tools. Spells such as make whole can heal constructs, and magic effects can heal undead. An unliving creature with fast healing still benefits from that ability.

      "Description": "A vortex ability works identically to the whirlwind ability (see below), except the creature gains a swim speed instead of a fly speed, it can form only in a liquid (such as in water), it cannot leave a liquid medium, and it always blocks all vision within it and line of sight past it.

      "Description": "The creature can transform into a whirlwind. Unless otherwise specified, the creature can remain in whirlwind form for a number of rounds equal to half its CR. If the creature has a fly speed, it retains that in its whirlwind form. If it does not have a fly speed, it gains an extraordinary fly speed (with average maneuverability) equal to its base speed. A creature in whirlwind form can move freely into and through other creatures' spaces, and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity as a result of its movement.\nThe base of a creature in whirlwind form occupies a 5-foot square, and the whirlwind is twice as wide at its top as its base and has a height equal to four times the width of its base; this doesn't change the size category of the creature. If a creature is Large or larger, it can vary the size of its whirlwind form up to a maximum of a base equal to its normal space as a swift or move action. A creature in whirlwind form does not threaten any spaces around it, and it cannot make its normal attacks.\nIf a creature in whirlwind form enters the space of another creature, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save with the listed DC or take the whirlwind's listed damage. If the whirlwind covers all of the creature's space, the creature must also succeed at a Reflex save or be picked up by the whirlwind and carried along with it. A carried creature is flatfooted, grappled, and off-target, and it automatically takes the whirlwind's damage at the beginning of its turn. If the carried creature can fly, it can attempt a Reflex save as a move action, escaping on a successful save. If a carried creature does not escape, it can attempt a Fortitude save; if it succeeds, it can take any remaining actions it has on its turn (other than movement). On a failed save, the carried creature is unable to act until its next turn or until the whirlwind releases it.\nA creature in whirlwind form can carry up to two creatures of its size, with the total number it can carry doubling for every size category the affected creatures are smaller than the whirlwind. The creature in whirlwind form can eject a carried creature at any time during its turn, dropping the carried creature in a space of its choice adjacent to its position at the time of ejection. At the GM's discretion, if the whirlwind is in contact with dirt, gases, water, or other material that can be easily drawn into it, the whirlwind blocks all vision within it (including darkvision) and blocks line of sight through it.",
